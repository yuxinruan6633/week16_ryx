## About the Paper

The study investigates how diatom blooms affect metal bioaccumulation in the clam *Ruditapes philippinarum*, through mechanisms including metal speciation changes and particle-associated uptake. A combination of stable isotope tracing, continuous-flow algal culture, feeding experiments, and toxicokinetic modeling was employed. The findings reveal that diatoms significantly increase the bioaccumulation of certain metals (e.g., Cd, Ni, Cu) in clams, highlighting the need to account for algal bloom conditions in ecological risk assessments.
